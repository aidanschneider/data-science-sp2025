*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at thre Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang 
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <- df_stang %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"), 
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "angle",
    starts_with("E") | starts_with("nu")
  ) %>% 
  filter(E >= 0, nu >= 0) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle))

df_stang_long 
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    nu

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - There is not, as Aluminum alloys can have different material
    properties based of characteristics including composition,
    thickness, and grain.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - Only 1 aluminum alloy type exists in this data set. I used
    “n_distinct” to count the number of distinct entries in the “alloy”
    column. This function returned a value of 1, meaning there is only
    one distinct entry in that column, so only one type of alloy.
- What angles were tested?
  - The angles tested were 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees from
    the direction of rolling.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - The thicknesses tested were 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081. I assume
    these values to be inches.
- (Write your own question here)

Question: What is the relationship between Young’s Modulus (E, a
material’s resistance to deformation) and Poisson’s Ratio (nu, measure
of deformation under stress) for Aluminum alloys?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q2 here

ggplot(df_stang_long) +
  geom_point(aes(x = E, y = nu)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(E,nu), method="lm") +
  ggtitle("Correlation Between Young's Modulus (E) and Poission's Ratio (nu)")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- (Address your question from q2 here) According to the plot above,
  there is a clear positive correlation between the Young’s Modulus (E)
  and the Possion’s Ratio (nu) of the aluminum alloys in this dataset.
  This is a reasonable conclusion to reach as a higher Poisson’s Ratio
  indicates that a material is harder to deform, while a higher Young’s
  Modulus indicates that a material is stiffer and thus changes its
  shape less under stress. Although we are able to see a correlation
  between these values based solely on the data in the data set, it
  would be beneficial to collect more data to determine if this
  correlation stands true not only for more samples of the particular
  alloy included in the dataset, but for other aluminum alloys and
  potentially other materials entirely.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

> “A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
> of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
> amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - The graph supports the claim made above, as the Elasticity values
    for all thicknesses except 0.081 are all nearly the same. The 0.081
    thickness samples do not align with the trends that the rest of the
    thicknesses do, which could result from differences in measurement
    techniques and tools used.
- Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
  - Although the evidence shows strong indication of a trend in this
    data set, we cannot say that the evidence is conclusive for all
    aluminum alloys or material types. More data would need to be
    collected in order to verify this fact by sticking with one method
    of measurement (using one type of strain gauge) to reduce
    variability in the data set, making more measurements of the same
    aluminum alloy, and/or making more measurements on other material
    types other than aluminum.
