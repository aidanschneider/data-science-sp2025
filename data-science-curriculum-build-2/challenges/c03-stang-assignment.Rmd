*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes, the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this challenge you'll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase "more data are necessary" without clarification | Any statement that "more data are necessary" specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission
<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without all files uploaded to GitHub.**


```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at thre Bureau of Standards tested a number of Aluminum plates to determine their [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio). These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such as aircraft skin under [buckling loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking)) direction.

# Loading and Wrangle
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data for this challenge.

```{r load}
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
df_stang 
```

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### __q1__ Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special value for `names_to`.

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <- df_stang %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"), 
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "angle",
    starts_with("E") | starts_with("nu")
  ) %>% 
  filter(E >= 0) %>% 
  # added for redundancy, in case nu was negative and E wasn't
  filter(nu >= 0)

df_stang_long$angle <- as.integer(df_stang_long$angle)
 
df_stang_long 
```

Use the following tests to check your work.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
              setequal(
                df_stang_long %>% names,
                c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "nu")
              )
            )
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
            )

print("Very good!")
```

# EDA
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks
<!-- ------------------------- -->

### __q2__ Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you'd like to answer about the data---you'll answer it below in q3.

```{r q2-task}

#Running simple checks based off Day 2 exercise best practices
df_stang_long %>% 
  glimpse() %>% 
  summary()


#using group_by() and summarise() to check relationship between different variables in the data set

df_stang_long %>% 
  group_by(thick) %>% 
  summarise(thick_mean = mean(E))

df_stang_long %>% 
  group_by(E) %>% 
  summarise(E_mean = mean(nu))

#checking the number of alloys in the data set

df_stang_long %>% 
  summarise(alloy_count = n_distinct(alloy))
  

```

**Observations**:

- Is there "one true value" for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - There is not, as Aluminum alloys can have different material properties based of characteristics including composition, thickness, and
    grain. 
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - Only 1 aluminum alloy type exists in this data set. I used "n_distinct" to count the number of distinct entries in the "alloy" column. This   function returned a value of 1, meaning there is only one distinct entry in that column, so only one type of alloy. 
- What angles were tested?
  - The angles tested were 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees from the angle of rolling
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - The thicknesses tested were 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, and 0.081. I assume these values to be inches.
- (Write your own question here)

Question: What is the relationship between Young's Modulus (E, a material's resistance to deformation) and Poisson's Ratio (nu, measure of deformation under stress) for Aluminum alloys?

## Visualize
<!-- ------------------------- -->

### __q3__ Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Investigate your question from q2 here

ggplot(df_stang_long) +
  geom_point(aes(x = E, y = nu)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(E,nu), method="lm") +
  ggtitle("Correlation Between Young's Modulus (E) and Poission's Ratio (nu)")


```

**Observations**:

- (Address your question from q2 here)
According to the plot above, there is a clear positive correlation between the Young's Modulus (E) and the Possion's Ratio (nu) of the aluminum alloys in this dataset. This is a reasonable conclusion to reach as a higher Poisson's Ratio indicates that a material is harder to deform, while a higher Young's Modulus indicates that a material is stiffer and thus changes its shape less under stress. Although we are able to see a correlation between these values based solely on the data in the data set, it would be beneficial to collect more data to determine if this correlation stands true not only for more samples of the particular alloy included in the dataset, but for other aluminum alloys and potentially other materials entirely. 




### __q4__ Consider the following statement:

> "A material's property (or material property) is an intensive property of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material."[2]

Note that the "amount of material" would vary with the thickness of a tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim that "elasticity `E` is an intensive material property." Why or why not? Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

```{r q4-vis}
## NOTE: No need to change; run this
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - The graph supports the claim made above, as the Elasticity values for all thicknesses except 0.081 are
    all nearly the same. The 0.081 thickness samples seem to be outliers as they do not match the pattern
    that the rest of the thicknesses do.
  
- Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
  - Although the evidence is conclusive for the set of materials tested in the data set, we cannot say
    that the evidence is conclusive for all aluminum alloys or material types. More data would need to 
    be collected in order to verify this fact by testing a larger array of materials.
